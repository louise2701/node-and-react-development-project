      <dt>Mutation</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Mutation refers to a genetic operator used in evolutionary algorithms to introduce random changes in individuals' genetic material, such as chromosomes or genes.</p>
        <p>Example: In a genetic algorithm, mutation might involve randomly flipping a bit in a binary string representing an individual's chromosome.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Genetic</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Genetic refers to the hereditary material or information carried by an organism's genes.</p>
        <p>Example: Genetic factors can influence an individual's physical traits, such as eye color or height.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Crossover</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Crossover, also known as recombination, is a genetic operator used in evolutionary algorithms to exchange genetic material between two parent individuals and produce offspring with combined traits.</p>
        <p>Example: In a genetic algorithm, crossover might involve swapping segments of two parent chromosomes to create new offspring chromosomes.</p>
